<b>Project Mission</b>: DMRG++ is a free and open source implementation of the DMRG algorithm. It emphasizes generic programming
using C++ templates, friendly user-interface, and as few software dependencies as possible.
DMRG++ tries to make writing new models and geometries easy, fast and bug-free by
using a generic DMRG engine.

	<li><b>Mar. 22, 2011:</b>: The CNMS has an <a href="http://cnms.ornl.gov/user/call_proposals.shtm">open call</a>

       work related to DMRG++. Also,
       feel free to use the alternative form in LaTeX, if you prefer.

	<del>As of <a href="https://github.com/g1257/dmrgpp/tree/c433d3d1f519f2298e5962d47ef23dc102a1e9bc">today's version</a>, 
	DMRG++ depends on the the GNU Scientific Library or GSL. 
	This is found in <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/">http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/</a>. 
	However, you might not need to download it, since many Linux distributions have it in their official repositories. 
	(e.g. in SUSE the GSL is found under the names of gsl and gsl-devel, you need both). 
	This is marked semi-optional, since you can work without the GSL, please see <i>Removing GSL Dependencies</i>, 
	in section 2.3 of the manual for more info.</del>
	<b>The GSL is no longer required in the default configuration.</b></li> 
	<li><b>Dec. 15, 2010:</b>: Manual updated: checkpoint section added, make sure you have at least 
	<a href="https://github.com/g1257/dmrgpp/commit/1c8fd4ffb0b8db62d44ae9f90aafcec3600b5172">today's version</a>. 
	Note also that you can generate a manual.pdf, by using the source under <tt>doc/manual.tex</tt> </li>
	<li><b>Dec. 13, 2010:</b> A page with issues has been posted.
		Contributions are appreciated. Thanks. </li>
	<li><b>Dec. 8, 2010:</b> DMRG++ now needs <a href="https://github.com/g1257/PsimagLite">PsimagLite</a> as a dependency.
	<font color="#00bb00">See section 2 of the manual 
		for more info.</font></li>

<b>DMRG++ to use Literate Programming: </b> 
	<a href="http://www.literateprogramming.com/">Literate programming</a> will be used from now on.
	Instead of documenting the code, we will add code to the documentation. This will enable the
	creation of a story instead of having scattered explanations here and there. There are already samples
	under doc in this website. The git repository already includes certain 
	<tt>.w</tt> files under src/Engine. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>News for August 26, 2010</b>
<ul>
<li>A new testsuite is available with the latest revision ( 276172be49d4193899ec ). Thanks to Ed. P. for contributing it!
The testsuite's manual is under TestSuite/testsuite.8 (do man -l testsuite.8 or less testsuite.8 to see it)</li>
<li>configure.pl no longer produces an input file. Please use a sample input file from inside
the TestSuite (under TestSuite/inputs/). An input.pl script to write input files is in the works.</li>
<li>Input file format has changed and so the manual is no longer up-to-date. Sorry to make
this highly visible change, but it was unavoidable. Again please see TestSuite/inputs for examples of inputs.
Also TestSuite/inputs/descriptions.txt for a description of each test. Input format will be moving to
<a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a> format in the (unforseable for now :-)) future.</li>
<li>One clarification about the manual: When updates are posted they will be announced in this section.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>June 29, 2010: Manual updated. See "Static Observables" section
to learn how to compute static observables.</li>
<li>June 29, 2010: You can follow DMRG++'s development (and its history) <a href="https://github.com/g1257/dmrgpp/commits/master">here</a></li>
<li>June 2, 2010: Posted the talk I gave at the March Meeting, under Documentation below</li>
<li>June 2, 2010: <b>DMRG++ Bleeding Edge Repository</b> has been posted (see below)</li>
<li>
<b>DMRG++ Bleeding Edge is Coming Up</b>
<ul>
<li>May 19, 2010: Preliminary Manual Posted here (It's incomplete, though)</li>
<li>May 18, 2010: Posted new schedule for <b>DMRG++ v2.2</b>, and Full <b>Manual</b>. Please see below under Schedule.</li>
<li>May 18, 2010: Also: I plan to release the full code (bleeding edge),
 and you'll be able to follow my coding through a git repo, with 
frequent commits.
Please stay tuned!
</li>
<li>May 18, 2010: Yes, I know there's not enough documentation yet. The 
Full Manual will fix this problem. Depending on interest 
 (feel free to drop me a line at gz1 at (@) ornl dot(.) gov if you want 
to express interest), I'll add lengthier explanations to the 
Full Manual. The release of the Bleeding Edge repository will also 
depend on interest. </li>
</ul> 
</li>
<li>
<b>Documentation Update, Manual Delayed</b>
<ul>
<li>March 10, 2010: I posted in cond-mat the paper on SU(2) symmetry implementation, see below, under Documentation.</li>
<li>March 11, 2010: The DMRG++ v2.0 manual is not ready yet, sorry, schedule has changed accordingly.</li>
